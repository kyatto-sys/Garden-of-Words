        <h1>Garden Rules</h1>

        <p>
            Garden of Words is a quiet place meant for reflection, honesty,
            and gentle expression. By stepping into this garden, you agree
            to walk with care.
        </p>

        <ul>
            🌱 You own the words you plant here. They remain yours. <br>
            🌼 Write with honesty, but not with harm.<br>
            🍃 Harassment, hate, or cruelty has no soil to grow in here.<br>
            🌿 Respect other writers — every voice is tender.<br>
            🪴 Content that breaks the spirit of the garden may be gently removed.
        </ul>

        <p>
            These rules exist not to confine you, but to keep this space
            safe, quiet, and kind — for you and for others.
        </p>

        <p>
            If something feels unclear, reach out. Gardens grow best
            when tended together.
