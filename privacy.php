        <h1>🤍 Our Privacy Promise</h1>

        <p>
            Your words are personal. We understand that.
            This garden was made for softness, not surveillance.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What we collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your username and email, so we know how to care for your account</li>
            <li>Your written works, only as you choose to share them</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What we do not do:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not sell your data</li>
            <li>We do not read private content unnecessarily</li>
            <li>We do not track you beyond what is needed for the garden to function</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Your password is encrypted and kept hidden, even from us.
            What is meant to be private stays private.
        </p>

        <p>
            If one day you choose to leave, your presence here does not follow you.
            Gardens remember seasons — not footprints.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you ever have concerns, questions, or unease,
            you may reach out. We listen.
        </p>
